# Hi! I'm Rena :)
I am currently in my second year at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, pursuing a diploma in Information Technology (IT). I am passionate in web development and have a growing interest in game development and 3D animation. 

I hope that I can futher develop my skills and knowledge in web development by working on different projects! Take a look at some of my more recent projects: 

## My Projects

    - [SustainableMe](https://github.com/mellamadrama/BED_Assignment_2024) : Website to promote environmental sustainability by encouraging users to track their logs and gain rewards!
